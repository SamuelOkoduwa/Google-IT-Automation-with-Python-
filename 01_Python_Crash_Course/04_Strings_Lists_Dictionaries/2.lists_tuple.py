# For List Vs List Comprehension
### Simple List Comprehension
print("List comprehension result:")

# The following list comprehension compacts several linesÂ 
# of code into one line:
print([x*2 for x in range(1,11)])

### Long form for loop
print("Long form code result:")

# The list comprehension above accomplishes the same result as
# the long form version of the code shown below:
my_list = []
for x in range(1,11):
    my_list.append(x*2)
print(my_list)

# Click Run to compare the two results.
