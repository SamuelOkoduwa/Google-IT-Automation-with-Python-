Question 1
This code is supposed to display "2 + 2 = 4" on the screen, but there is an error. Find the error in the code and fix it, so that the output is correct.

The solution below
'''
print("2 + 2 = " + str(2 + 2))

# 2.
'''In this scenario, two friends are eating dinner at a restaurant. The bill comes in the amount of 47.28 dollars. The friends decide to split the bill evenly between them, after adding 15% tip for the service. Calculate the tip, the total amount to pay, and each friend's share, then output a message saying "Each person needs to pay: " followed by the resulting number.

The solution below
'''
bill = 42.28 # Assign "bill" variable with bill amount
tip = bill * 0.15 # Multiply by stated tip rate 
total = bill + (bill * 0.15) # Sum the "total" of the "bill" and "tip"
share = total / 2 # Divide "total" by number of friends dining
print("Each person needs to pay " + str(share)) # Enter the required string and "share" 
# Hint: Remember to convert incompatible data types
