# The greater than > operator checks if the left string has a higher 
# Unicode value than the right string. If true, the Python interpreter
# returns a True result. Since W has a Unicode value of 87, and you can 
# easily calculate that F has a Unicode value of 70, this comparison is
# the same as 87 > 70. As this is true, Python will return a True 
# result.
print("Wednesday" > "Friday")
True
 
 
# The less than < operator checks if the left string has a lower 
# Unicode value than the right string. If you reference the Unicode 
# chart above, you can see that all lowercase letters have higher 
# Unicode values than uppercase letters. We can see that B has a 
# Unicode value of 66 and b has a Unicode value of 98. This 
# comparison is the same as 66 < 98, which is true. So, Python will 
# return a True result.
print("Brown" < "brown")
True


# If the strings have the same first few letters, the comparison will 
# cycle through each letter of each string, from left to right until it 
# finds two letters that have different Unicode values. In this example, 
# both strings share the initial substring "sun", but then have 
# different letters with different Unicode values in the fourth place 
# in each string. So, the fourth letters 'b' and 't' of the two
# strings are used for the comparison. Since 'b' does not have a higher
# Unicode value than 't', the comparison returns a False result.
print("sunbathe" > "suntan")
False


# If two identical strings are compared using the less than < comparison
# operator, this will produce a False result because they are equal.
print("Lima" < "Lima")
False


# This last example illustrates the result of trying to compare two
# items of different data types using the less than < operator. The 
# greater than > and less than operators < cannot be used to compare
# two different data types.

    Question 4
Is "A dog" smaller or larger than "A mouse"? Is 9999+8888 smaller or larger than 100*100? Replace the plus sign with a comparison operator in the following code to let Python check it for you and then answer. The result should return True if the correct comparison operator is used. 
print("A dog" + "A mouse")
print(9999+8888 + 100*100) 

The solution below
'''
print("A dog" < "A mouse")
print(9999+8888 > 100*100)

    Question 5
If a filesystem has a block size of 4096 bytes, this means that a file comprised of only one byte will still use 4096 bytes of storage. A file made up of 4097 bytes will use 4096*2=8192 bytes of storage. Knowing this, can you fill in the gaps in the calculate_storage function below, which calculates the total number of bytes needed to store a file of a given size?

def calculate_storage(filesize):
    block_size = 4096
    # Use floor division to calculate how many blocks are fully occupied
    full_blocks = ___
    # Use the modulo operator to check whether there's any remainder
    partial_block_remainder = ___
    # Depending on whether there's a remainder or not, return
    # the total number of bytes required to allocate enough blocks
    # to store your data.
    if partial_block_remainder > 0:
        return ___
    return ___

print(calculate_storage(1))    # Should be 4096
print(calculate_storage(4096)) # Should be 4096
print(calculate_storage(4097)) # Should be 8192
print(calculate_storage(6000)) # Should be 8192
